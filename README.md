# hello-world
<h4>This is my first GitHub repository.</h4>
<p>I am slowly learning stuff.</p>
<p>It will likely take some time to get this, but repositories branches and commits seem simply enough.</p>
<h4>Fear</h4>
<p>Its not something I normally suffer from but with this new technology, I am suffering from it a bit.</p>
<p>There is going to be a lot to learn in a short period of time and I need to get it down...and fast.</p>
